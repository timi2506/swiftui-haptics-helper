# Haptics
My first real project with very little AI use

## What is this?
Haptics is a simple little App to Test Haptics available with the Swift Package ["HapticEase"](https://github.com/emreeilhan/HapticEase)
and create + copy code for it with ease, it also has a quick little guide on how to add the Package and it's Haptics to your Project!
